## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that helps track changes to files and enables collaboration among multiple contributors. It allows you to revert to previous versions of your work and manage multiple versions of your project.

## Git vs GitHub

Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your code locally, while GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories online and provides collaboration tools such as pull requests, issues, and wikis.

## GitHub Alternatives

- GitLab: A web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager.
- Bitbucket: A platform for Git and Mercurial code repositories.
- SourceForge: A web-based service for software developers to manage their projects and code repositories.

## Git Fetch vs Git Pull

- git fetch: Downloads updates from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch.
- git pull: Downloads and merges updates from the remote repository into your current branch.

## What is Git Rebase?

Git rebase is a way of integrating changes from one branch into another by rewriting the commit history. It helps maintain a linear project history.
Command: `git rebase <branch-name>`

## What is Git Cherry-Pick?

Git cherry-pick allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch onto another, without merging the entire branch.
Command: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
